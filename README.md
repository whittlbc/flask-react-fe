# Flask React Front-end

## Requirements

* npm
* node.js
* ruby
* sass

## Installation

1. Make sure `npm` and `node.js` are installed:

```
$ npm -v
```
```
$ node -v
```

If not, Homebrew makes it easy:  

```
$ brew install node 
```

2. Install `sass`:

````
$ gem install sass
````

3. Clone this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/whittlbc/flask-react-fe && cd flask-react-fe
```

4. Install node modules

```
$ npm install
```

Note: If this fails, try deleting `package-json.lock` and retrying.

## Usage

To run the app, have 2 terminal tabs open:

**Tab 1**<br>

- Job:  Allow live reloading of CSS files<br>
- Execute:  `$ npm run sass`<br>
- Note:  Don't modify any `.css` files directly, as these are auto-generated by sass. Only style the `.scss` files.<br>

**Tab 2**<br>

- Job:  Host the app<br>
- Execute:  `$ npm start`<br>

## Adding a new stylesheet

To add a new stylesheet and make it available to sass:<br>

1. Create a new `.scss` file inside `src/styles/scss`.
2. Import your new `.scss` file inside `src/styles/scss/index.scss`.
    
## Making Ajax Requests

There's a singleton helper class, located at `src/utils/Ajax.js` that can be used for this. There's an example `GET` request shown using this class at the top of that file.

## Proxy

At the bottom of `package.json`, the `"proxy"` key lets you set a proxy url for any API requests made. Currently it's set to `http://localhost:5000`, as this app runs on port `3000`. 

## Heroku

This app can be run on Heroku using [this buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static).

Before pushing to Heroku, make sure to change the `<HEROKU_APP_NAME>` inside `static.hjson` to be the Heroku app name of your Heroku-hosted server-side app.

## Setting up SSL support

Once you have a domain name secured for your site, you can set up SSL support with LetsEncrypt and certbot.

**Install `certbot` and start the certificate creation process**

```
$ brew install certbot
```

```
$ sudo certbot certonly --manual
```

**Follow the instructions and enter the name of the domain you want to secure (e.g. `www.mydomain.com`).**

It should then ask you to make sure your web server displays a certain text value at a specified url on your site:

```
Make sure your web server displays the following content at
http://www.sonders.co/.well-known/acme-challenge/xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyy.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz before continuing:

aaaaaaaaaaaa-bbbb.cccccccccccccccccccc
```

If you're using [flask-react-be](https://github.com/whittlbc/flask-react-be) for your server, there's already a route set up to handle this certificate verification. The only thing that needs to be done is to set the following environment variables on your Heroku-hosted server-side app:

```
LETSENCRYPT_ROUTE_KEY: value shown as xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyy.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz above
LETSENCRYPT_RESPONSE_KEY: value shown as aaaaaaaaaaaa-bbbb.cccccccccccccccccccc above
```  

Wait a minute for those environment variables to take effect, and then press ENTER to have certbot verify that API endpoint.

If all goes well, it should tell you congratulations and give you the location of the created certificate.

**Add the SSL Endpoint add-on to our Heroku-hosted React app:**

```
$ heroku addons:create ssl:endpoint -a this-heroku-app-name
```

**Upload your certificate to Heroku**

```
$ heroku certs:add /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.mydomain.com/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.mydomain.com/privkey.pem -a this-heroku-app-name
```

To verify this worked, you can run the following and see the details of your uploaded certificate:

```
$ heroku certs:info -a this-heroku-app-name
```

**Make the following modifications to your `static.hjson` file:**

    a. Change each of your `"origin"` proxy keys to have a `https` scheme.
    b. Add the following key-val pair: `"https_only": true`
    
**If using [flask-react-be](https://github.com/whittlbc/flask-react-be) for your server-side app, give its Heroku app the following environment variable:**

```
REQUIRE_SSL: true
```

**Add your custom domain to your Heroku app:**

```
$ heroku domains:add www.mydomain.com -a this-heroku-app-name
$ heroku domains:add mydomain.com -a this-heroku-app-name
```

You should then have 2 DNS targets provided to you by Heroku that look something `www.mydomain.com.herokudns.com` and `mydomain.com.herokudns.com`, respectively.

**Add a `CNAME` record to your domain with a Host of `*` that points to `mydomain.com.herokudns.com`. Optionally, you can then add domain forwarding to `https://www.mydomain.com`.**
